### A little about me

I am a proggrammer who loves Devil May Cry, Yakuza, Zenless Zone Zero and the likes. I also love Dungeons and Dragons, drawing and trying my hand at whatever crosses my path. 

The gif that is this websites background is my Year 1 University project, I stretched myself with unreal to create an entire city which was way beyond the scope of the module.

And below are a couple of examples of what I do outside of proggramming.

#### Heres a drawing of Pyke from League of Legends by me.
