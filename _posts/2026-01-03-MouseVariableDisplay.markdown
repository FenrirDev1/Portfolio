### Why?
---
The purpose of this tool is to allow designers, programmers etc easier debugging in the unity workspace. I chose to make this particular tool as Unity Debugging in real time can be rather diffuclt. This feature is inspired by the watch window in the visual studio debugger which I use endlessly in my debugging outside unity.

The tool allows any custom MonoBehaviour with serialisable fields to be 'watched' or debugged alongside having the ability to hover over the heirarchy to see the chosen variables. 

### Features

### Reflection
---
I plan on revisiting this project when I get some time and working on it further with some added functionality and changes to some UI elements.

**Some changes include**
**Hotkeys** - such as for quickly adding something to the watch list or toggling MVD

**More functionality** - such as a sprite viewer

**Multiple watch windows**, drag out object out of main watch so you can have mutiple easily for example.

**Watch all Instance of x or y**

<br>
These are just some ideas of what I could implement to this project further in the future.
